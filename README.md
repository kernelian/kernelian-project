# The Kernelian Operating System or KNU (Kernelian's not UNIX!)

Kernelian is an i386 OS that can run on (almost, no floppy support since Kernelian is growing and the image can't be fit on a floppy) any i386 computer!

It's not perfect, because it can have weird bugs all the time. (and sometimes some feature removals because of that)

# Kind of bugs and real bugs
